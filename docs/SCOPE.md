# VCoin (VCN) Audit Scope

This document defines the scope of the security audit for the VCoin (VCN) token implementation.

## Project Overview

VCoin (VCN) is a utility token implemented on the Solana blockchain using the Token-2022 program. The token has a fixed supply of 1 billion VCN, which is allocated to development, presale, airdrops, and vesting according to the tokenomics defined in the project documentation.

## Files in Scope

The following files are in scope for this audit:

| File | Description | Priority |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `src/utils.ts` | Core utilities for key management, token operations, and metadata | HIGH |
| `src/create-token.ts` | Token creation implementation | HIGH |
| `src/allocate-token.ts` | Token allocation implementation | HIGH |
| `src/update-metadata.ts` | Token metadata implementation | HIGH |
| `src/presale.ts` | Presale implementation | MEDIUM |
| `src/vesting.ts` | Vesting schedule implementation | MEDIUM |
| `src/index.ts` | Main entry point and CLI commands | LOW |

## Areas of Specific Concern

Please pay particular attention to the following areas:

### 1. Token Creation and Supply Management
- Verify that the token supply is correctly implemented and cannot be modified after creation
- Check for proper validation of token parameters
- Verify that token creation is properly secured with appropriate authority controls

### 2. Key Management
- Review the key management implementation in `utils.ts`
- Verify that keypairs are securely generated, stored, and loaded
- Check for potential issues with keypair access control

### 3. Token Allocation
- Verify that token allocation correctly follows the defined tokenomics
- Check for proper validation of allocation parameters
- Verify that all tokens are accounted for after allocation

### 4. Metadata Security
- Review the metadata implementation for security issues
- Verify that metadata updates require proper authorization
- Check for potential manipulation of metadata

### 5. Transaction Security
- Review all transaction construction and submission
- Verify proper error handling for failed transactions
- Check for transaction simulation before submission

### 6. Input Validation
- Review all input validation throughout the codebase
- Check for potential bypasses or edge cases
- Verify that all user inputs are properly validated

### 7. Error Handling
- Review error handling throughout the codebase
- Verify that errors are properly logged without exposing sensitive information
- Check for potential information leakage through error messages

## Out of Scope

The following are considered out of scope for this audit:

1. Underlying Solana blockchain security
2. Security of external dependencies 
3. Front-end applications that may interact with the token
4. Issues related to the Solana Token-2022 program itself
5. Development environment security

## Security Assumptions

This audit operates under the following security assumptions:

1. The Solana blockchain and its default programs operate as expected
2. The environment hosting the private keys is secure
3. The RPC endpoints used are trusted and secure
4. The npm packages used have been properly vetted

## Known Issues or Limitations

The following are known issues or limitations that are already being addressed:

1. The token currently displays as "Unknown Token" in Solana Explorer due to metadata issues
2. The current implementation does not include multi-signature support for administrative operations
3. Transaction simulation is not fully implemented for all operations

## Deliverables Expected from Audit

We expect the following deliverables from the audit:

1. A detailed report of all identified vulnerabilities
2. Severity rating for each vulnerability
3. Recommendations for fixing each vulnerability
4. General code quality feedback
5. Suggestions for security improvements
