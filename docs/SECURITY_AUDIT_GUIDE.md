## Introduction

This document serves as a guide for security auditors reviewing the VCoin project. It highlights security-critical components, potential vulnerabilities, and areas requiring special attention during the audit process.

The VCoin project is a comprehensive Solana token implementation with features including token creation, metadata management, token allocation, presale functionality, and vesting capabilities.

## Security Critical Components

### High-Priority Components

   - `utils.ts`: `getOrCreateKeypair()`
   - `create-token.ts`: `getKeypairFromPhantom()`

2. **Token Transfer Operations**:
   - `allocate-token.ts`: `allocateTokens()`
   - `presale.ts`: `processPurchase()`
   - `vesting.ts`: `executeRelease()`

3. **Authorization Checks**:
   - `allocate-token.ts`: Authority verification
   - `update-metadata.ts`: Signature verification
   - `vesting.ts`: Authority validation

4. **File System Operations**:
   - `utils.ts`: File read/write operations
   - All modules: Configuration file management

### Medium-Priority Components

1. **Configuration Validation**:
   - `utils.ts`: Environment variable validation

2. **Error Handling**:
   - All modules: Error propagation and handling

3. **Input Validation**:
   - All modules: User input validation

## Audit Scope

## Potential Vulnerabilities

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Private Key Exposure**
   - Risk: Unprotected storage or transmission of private keys
   - Impact: Complete compromise of token authority
   - Files to review: `utils.ts`, `create-token.ts`
   
   **Current Mitigations**:
   - Keypairs are stored in a separate, gitignored `keypairs/` directory
   - Strict file permissions are enforced for keypair files
   - Input validation prevents path traversal in keypair names
   - Clear user warnings about private key security in CLI interfaces
   - Implementation in `utils.ts:170-220` includes validation, secure storage, and error handling

2. **Unauthorized Token Transfers**
   - Risk: Missing or incorrect authority checks
   - Impact: Theft of tokens
   - Files to review: `allocate-token.ts`, `presale.ts`, `vesting.ts`
   
   **Current Mitigations**:
   - Authority verification before all token transfers (see `allocate-token.ts:120-135`)
   - Public key matching against stored metadata
   - Transaction signing with proper authority keypair
   - Comprehensive tests for authority verification (see `tests/unit/allocate-token.test.ts`)

3. **Path Traversal**
   - Risk: Insufficient validation of file paths
   - Impact: Unauthorized file access
   - Files to review: `utils.ts` (file system operations)
   
   **Current Mitigations**:
   - Path validation in `utils.ts:160-175` checks for ".." and path separator characters
   - Explicit regex validation for keypair names and other file paths
   - Tests specifically targeting path traversal attempts (see `tests/unit/utils-coverage.spec.js`)

4. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**
   - Risk: Insufficient handling of large token amounts
   - Impact: Incorrect token transfers, possible theft
   - Files to review: `utils.ts` (token conversion functions)
   
   **Current Mitigations**:
   - Use of BigInt for all token amount calculations
   - Boundary checks for token conversions in `utils.ts:50-70`
   - Explicit error handling for negative amounts
   - Tests for edge cases with very large token amounts (see `tests/unit/utils-coverage.spec.js`)

### Medium-Risk Areas

1. **Metadata Tampering**
   - Risk: Insufficient integrity checking
   - Impact: Incorrect token parameters
   - Files to review: `utils.ts` (metadata functions)
   
   **Current Mitigations**:
   - Checksum validation for metadata integrity in `utils.ts:330-345`
   - SHA-256 hash verification of metadata content
   - Required field validation for metadata objects
   - Tests for tampered metadata scenarios (see `tests/unit/utils.test.ts`)

2. **Input Validation Bypasses**
   - Risk: Insufficient input sanitization
   - Impact: Injection attacks, unexpected behavior
   - Files to review: All user input handling
   
   **Current Mitigations**:
   - Type checking and boundary validation for all inputs
   - Regex validation for string inputs
   - Explicit error messages for validation failures
   - Tests specifically targeting boundary conditions and invalid inputs

3. **Error Handling Issues**
   - Risk: Improper error handling
   - Impact: Information leakage, system instability
   - Files to review: All error handling logic
   
   **Current Mitigations**:
   - Centralized error handling through `handleError` function
   - Environment-aware error handling (different behavior for test/production)
   - Graceful process termination with descriptive error messages
   - Comprehensive error testing (see `tests/unit/handleError.spec.js`)
