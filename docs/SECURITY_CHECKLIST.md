# VCoin Security Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive security checklist for the VCoin token implementation. Use this checklist to verify that all security controls are properly implemented before submitting the codebase for audit.

## 1. Input Validation

- [ ] All user inputs are validated before use
- [ ] Public key inputs are validated using Solana's PublicKey constructor
- [ ] Token amounts are validated to be non-negative
- [ ] Date inputs are validated for correctness
- [ ] Environment variables are validated at startup
- [ ] File paths are sanitized to prevent path traversal
- [ ] JSON inputs are validated against expected schemas

## 2. Authentication and Authorization

- [ ] All administrative functions require appropriate keypair signatures
- [ ] Mint authority is properly controlled
- [ ] Update authority for metadata is properly controlled
- [ ] Token transfers require proper authorization
- [ ] Presale operations require administrative authorization
- [ ] Vesting operations require administrative authorization

## 3. Key Management

- [ ] Keypairs are stored securely with appropriate file permissions
- [ ] Keypair files are excluded from version control
- [ ] Keypair generation uses secure random number generation
- [ ] Keypair loading validates the format of loaded keys
- [ ] Keypair files are protected from unauthorized access
- [ ] Backup procedures for keypairs are documented

## 4. Transaction Security

- [ ] All transactions are simulated before submission
- [ ] Transaction fees are properly handled
- [ ] Transaction retries are implemented for transient failures
- [ ] Transaction signatures are verified
- [ ] Recent blockhash is used for transactions
- [ ] Transaction confirmation is properly awaited

## 5. Error Handling

- [ ] All functions have proper error handling
- [ ] Errors are logged with appropriate context
- [ ] Sensitive information is not exposed in error messages
- [ ] Failed transactions are properly handled
- [ ] System recovers gracefully from errors
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly

## 6. Data Integrity

- [ ] Token metadata includes integrity checks (checksums)
- [ ] File operations validate data before and after operations
- [ ] Database operations (if any) include integrity checks
- [ ] Metadata updates maintain data consistency
- [ ] Token allocations are verified to match total supply
- [ ] Vesting schedule maintains integrity of token distribution

## 7. Secure Coding Practices

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in the codebase
- [ ] No debug code in production
- [ ] No commented-out code in production
- [ ] Consistent code style and formatting
- [ ] Functions follow single responsibility principle
- [ ] Code is modular and maintainable

## 8. Solana-Specific Security

- [ ] Proper handling of PDAs (Program Derived Addresses)
- [ ] Proper use of Token-2022 program features
- [ ] Proper handling of rent-exemption
- [ ] Proper handling of account ownership
- [ ] Proper handling of instruction data
- [ ] Proper handling of cross-program invocation

## 9. Metadata Security

- [ ] Token metadata is properly validated
- [ ] Metadata updates require proper authorization
- [ ] Metadata is protected from unauthorized modification
- [ ] Metadata includes all required fields
- [ ] Metadata URI (if used) points to secure location
- [ ] Metadata follows Metaplex standards

## 10. Configuration Security

- [ ] Environment variables have secure defaults
- [ ] Configuration files are properly secured
- [ ] Sensitive configuration is not exposed
- [ ] Network configuration is properly validated
- [ ] Development/production environments are properly separated
- [ ] Configuration changes require proper authorization

## 11. Dependency Security

- [ ] All dependencies are up-to-date
- [ ] Dependencies are from trusted sources
- [ ] Dependencies are pinned to specific versions
- [ ] No known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] Dependency updates are reviewed for security
- [ ] Unused dependencies are removed

## 12. Logging and Monitoring

- [ ] Security events are properly logged
- [ ] Logs do not contain sensitive information
- [ ] Log levels are appropriate
- [ ] Logs are properly formatted
- [ ] Critical operations are logged
- [ ] Error conditions are logged

## 13. Testing

- [ ] Security-focused tests are implemented
- [ ] Edge cases are tested
- [ ] Error conditions are tested
- [ ] Input validation is tested
- [ ] Authorization is tested
- [ ] Transaction handling is tested

## 14. Documentation

- [ ] Security controls are documented
- [ ] Key management procedures are documented
- [ ] Error handling procedures are documented
- [ ] Recovery procedures are documented
- [ ] Security assumptions are documented
- [ ] Known limitations are documented

## 15. Deployment Security

- [ ] Deployment procedures are documented
- [ ] Deployment requires proper authorization
- [ ] Production deployments are verified
- [ ] Rollback procedures are documented
- [ ] Emergency procedures are documented
- [ ] Post-deployment verification is performed

## Pre-Audit Security Review

Before submitting for audit, perform a final security review:

1. Review all items in this checklist
2. Run all security-focused tests
3. Perform a manual code review focusing on security
4. Verify that all known security issues are addressed
5. Document any known security limitations or concerns
6. Prepare a list of specific security questions for auditors

## Post-Audit Security Maintenance

After receiving audit results:

1. Address all identified vulnerabilities
2. Prioritize fixes based on severity
3. Re-test after implementing fixes
4. Update documentation with security improvements
5. Establish ongoing security monitoring
6. Plan for regular security reviews
