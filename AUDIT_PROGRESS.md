# VCoin Audit Preparation Progress

## Current Status

### Test Coverage
- Overall test coverage: 50.29% (up from 44.24%)
- Working tests: 53 passing tests across 12 test suites
- 1 failing test suite (allocate-token.test.ts) due to TypeScript/Jest configuration issues

### Coverage by File

| File | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines | Notes |
|------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------|
| allocate-token.ts | 84.53 | 25 | 50 | 84.53 | Good statement coverage, needs more branch testing |
| create-token.ts | 46.59 | 50 | 20 | 46.59 | Improved from 0%, needs more function coverage |
| index.ts | 98.5 | 72 | 100 | 98.5 | Excellent coverage |
| presale.ts | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Unit tests created but using mock approach due to process.exit issues |
| update-metadata.ts | 75 | 52.94 | 75 | 78.26 | Good coverage, needs more branch testing |
| utils.ts | 74.24 | 64.47 | 100 | 75.96 | Good coverage, needs more branch testing |
| vesting.ts | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Unit tests created but using mock approach, similar to presale tests |

## Remaining Tasks

1. Fix the failing test suite for allocate-token.test.ts
2. Increase test coverage for files with 0% coverage:
   - presale.ts - Tests created but using mock approach due to process.exit issues
   - vesting.ts - Tests created but using mock approach, similar to presale tests
3. Improve branch coverage for:
   - allocate-token.ts
   - update-metadata.ts
   - utils.ts
4. Add specific security tests for:
   - Input validation
   - Error handling
   - Edge cases
5. Update documentation with security recommendations

## Approach for Remaining Work

1. Create source code-based tests for presale.ts and vesting.ts:
   - Either modify the source code to make it more testable (export functions, avoid process.exit)
   - Or use a different approach like dependency injection
2. Focus on branch coverage by adding tests for conditional logic
3. Add more security-focused tests
4. Update documentation

## Timeline

- Estimated time to complete test coverage requirements: 2-3 days
- Estimated time for final documentation and cleanup: 1 day
- Total estimated time until audit-ready: 3-4 days

## Notes

- The JavaScript-based testing approach is working well for avoiding TypeScript issues
- We've made significant progress:
  - Created functional tests for presale.ts and vesting.ts (although they don't count for coverage yet)
  - Increased create-token.ts coverage from 0% to 46.59%
  - Overall coverage has increased from 44.24% to 50.29%
- Next steps should focus on fixing the source code-based test approach to improve coverage stats

## Conclusion

We've made significant progress on improving test coverage and quality. The remaining work is well-defined and achievable within a reasonable timeframe. With the completion of these tasks, VCoin will be properly prepared for a professional security audit.
